# Python-Data-Types

Every value has a datatype, and variables can hold values.  The interpreter binds the value implicitly to its type. We did not specify the type of the variable a, which has the value five from an integer. The Python interpreter will automatically interpret the variable as an integer. 

# Standard data types
A variable can contain a variety of values. On the other hand, a person's id must be stored as an integer, while their name must be stored as a string.

The storage method for each of the standard data types that Python provides is specified by Python. The following is a list of the Python-defined data types.

1. Numbers
2. Sequence Type
  2.1 String
  2.2 List
  2.3 Tuple 
3. Boolean
4. Set
5. Dictionary
